# Press when you miss me :3

An app created by ZcraftElite for his 1 year anniversary with his lovely boyfriend.

## What does it do?

Being my first 3DS Application I have ever developed, its pretty simple, often using parts of code from devkitPro's examples and simple C code. It picks a random message from a selection of cute little messages and shows them to my lovely boyfriend, so he can remember how much I love him whenever he misses me.

## How do I built it myself?

Step 1. Download the repository's main branch using Github Desktop, git's command line tool, Download ZIP, or any other tool.

Step 2. Ensure you have installed devkitPro on your computer. If you do not have it installed, you can get the latest release from https://devkitpro.org/.

Step 3. To just create a 3dsx file (for use the the homebrew launcher), just run `make`, to build into a installable .cia file to install to your 3ds' home screen, use `makecia` (`makecia.bat`).

## There is some random lines that look like [---], what does it mean?

In order to not doxx myself, or my boyfriend in any way whatsoever, I have replaced some bits of personal information with boxes similar to `[---]` tha match the length of the term that was originally in the application. 

## Can I utilize this code myself?

Sure! Just don't steal my pretty messages and write your own!
